# 🏁 Practice Lap — CAD  

“And away we go! The first lap of Project: Aero. The garage doors are open, the tools are out, and the focus is on turning rough ideas into geometry that can actually be tested.”  

Hi, Saaim here👋 Welcome to the practice lap! This stage begins with the 2026 F1 regulations 📜 The new rules bring narrower cars, simplified aero and movable elements, all designed to reduce dirty air and keep racing close. Within those constraints, the target is to create a baseline front wing in Siemens NX.  

NX was chosen as the baseline CAD tool after advice from industry engineers, with CATIA as a natural future step once I’m confident in NX.

I thought about including the new active aerodynamics — Z-mode for high downforce in corners and X-mode for low drag on the straights — but decided to keep it simpler for now. That can be a future project 👀  

So before any sketches or CAD, it’s time to check the rulebook!

## 📏 2026 front wing — the rules!

The FIA trims the 2026 front-wing span by ~100 mm versus today, down to **1900 mm**.  
It must be one continuous assembly (mainplane, flap, endplates, pylons) and the flap can rotate about a fixed axis for active aero. Endplates have to sit inside the FIA “boxes” and the join into the nose has to be smooth. The headline is simple: **fit the geometry inside the FIA reference volumes first, then chase aero within those limits.**

Full details: [FIA 2026 Technical Regulations (PDF)](./fia_2026_formula_1_technical_regulations_issue_8_-_2024-06-24.pdf)

**Implications for my design**
- Narrower span means less room for each element.
- Flap hinge line is fixed by the rules, so flap thickness & clearance need respect.
- I’m skipping the active “Z/X-mode” for v1 so I can focus on a clean baseline.
  Though I will come back to this in a future project!

## 🧭 Build plan & scaling

I’ll model a **full-size half-span** wing in NX (so 950 mm if the full span is 1900 mm). From there I’ll produce two physical versions:

1) **Wind-tunnel test article — half-span at 25% scale**  
   - Size: **237.5 mm** span (fits my 250 mm build plate for the Bambu A1)  
   - One-piece print if possible, otherwise 2-piece with alignment pins  
   - Used for tunnel testing and comparisons to CFD

2) **Display piece — full-span at ~35% scale**  
   - Size: **~665 mm** span (for photos, not tunnel)  
   - Printed in 3–4 sections with pins & epoxy sleeves  
   - Lets me show the full geometry without needing a huge tunnel

If the tunnel ends up smaller, I’ll drop the half-span scale to 20% to keep things practical!
