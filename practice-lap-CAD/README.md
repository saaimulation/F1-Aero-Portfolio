# 🏁 Practice Lap — CAD  

“And away we go! The first lap of Project: Aero. The garage doors are open, the tools are out, and the focus is on turning rough ideas into geometry that can actually be tested.”  

Hi, Saaim here 👋 Welcome to the practice lap! This stage begins with the 2026 F1 regulations 📜 The new rules bring narrower cars, simplified aero and movable elements, all designed to reduce dirty air and keep racing close. Within those constraints, the target is to create a baseline front wing in Siemens NX.  

NX was chosen as the baseline CAD tool after advice from industry engineers, with CATIA as a natural future step once I’m confident in NX.

I thought about including the new active aerodynamics — Z-mode for high downforce in corners and X-mode for low drag on the straights — but decided to keep it simpler for now. That can be a future project 👀  

So before any sketches or CAD, it’s time to check the rulebook!
