# 🏎️ F1-Aero-Portfolio  
Designing wings that (almost) qualify for Monaco — CAD → CFD → 3D print → Wind Tunnel  

Welcome! This repo showcases my Formula 1-inspired engineering projects — from CAD design to CFD simulations, 3D printing, and wind tunnel testing.  

I’m still early in the journey, so you’ll (hopefully) see the quality of my work improve lap by lap. Reach out on LinkedIn if you have advice, feedback, or opportunities — I’d love to connect.

## 🚦 Engineering Workflow ("Laps")  

1. **🏁 Practice Lap – Aero Foundations**  
   Learning CAD and aero basics. First sketches, early ideas, and learning notes.  

2. **🚦 Qualifying Lap – Front Wing Development**  
   Designing and simulating a scaled-down front wing. CAD in SolidWorks, CFD in STAR-CCM+, first results.  

3. **🏎️ Race Lap – Wind Tunnel Validation**  
   3D printing and testing in a homemade wind tunnel. Smoke/tuft visualisation and performance measurements.  

4. **📊 Podium Review – Analysis & Iteration**  
   Post-test analysis, reporting, and lessons learned for the next design cycle.
