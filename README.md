# Project: Aero 🏎️
Designing wings that (almost) qualify for Monaco — CAD → CFD → 3D print → Wind Tunnel  

Welcome to the BATCAVE🦇 

This repo is where I document my Formula 1-inspired aero projects.  
From sketches in NX to simulations in SimScale and 3D prints at 3 am, as well as smoke tests in a homemade wind-tunnel.

IT'S ALL HERE!

I’m still early in the journey, so you’ll (hopefully) see the quality of my work improve lap by lap.  
Grab a coffee (or duct tape) and enjoy the race ;)

## 🚦 Engineering Workflow Grand Prix

### 🏁 Practice Lap — Aero Foundations  
Learning CAD and aero basics. First sketches, early ideas, and plenty of mistakes.  

### 🚦 Qualifying Lap — Front Wing Development  
Designing a simplified F1-style front wing in Siemens NX.  
Inspired by RB19 + McLaren shapes, while keeping an eye on 2026 regs.  

### 🏎️ Race Lap — CFD in SimScale  
Running an AoA sweep, plotting Cp maps, chasing vortices, and waiting for progress bars.  

### 🖨️ Pit Stop — 3D Printing  
Half-span model on the Bambu A1. STL files, slicer settings. 

### 🌬️ Grand Prix — Wind Tunnel Mark II  
Testing the wing in a homemade tunnel with smoke/tufts.  
The big question: does the air agree with the CFD?  

### 📊 Podium Review — Analysis & Iteration  
5-page executive summary (in `/docs/`) comparing CFD vs tunnel.  
Lessons learned, what broke, and ideas for the next design cycle.  

Got feedback, advice, or better duct tape recommendations?  
I’m all ears, the whole point is to learn, improve, and share the journey! 🏎️🦇
